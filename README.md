# Git Studies

This is a repository created so I can **learn**, **apply** and **share** any studies made regarding git, It's tools and workflows.

# Local Specifications

For future inconsistencies or divergences, I'll be provinding information about hardware and software, so anyone out there *(including my future self)* can compare any commands or codes to their own configurations.
